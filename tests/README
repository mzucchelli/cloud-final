We have integration tests for testing the API using postman.

1. Import the accompanying Tracker.postman_collection.json into postman
2. Since the API is protected through a JWT access token, we'll need to set 
   an the acccessToken variable.
     1. Click the 3 dots to the right of "Tracker" and select edit.
     2. Click on the Variables Tab.
     3. To obtain an accessToken to use here, sign into the web app with
        the account you created, and then open the web developer tools (F12 usually)
        From the console, type "sessionStorage.accessToken" and copy the token.
     4. Paste the token into the acccessToken variable in postman.
        (note: the token is only good for an hour, if you need a new one, sign back in
         and get a new one)
3. You'll also need to set the tradeEndpoint variable.  If you are running this locally
   through docker-compose, copy the Initial Value to the Current value.  Otherwise, use
   the appropriate URL for your environment.
4. Ignore the tradeId variable, this will be set by the tests.
5. Time to run the tests.
    1. Start with Create Trade, and click Send. See the test results in the Test Results tab below.
       This will set the tradeId variable with the newly inserted ID, which the Update Trade, and Delete Trade
       will use.
    2. Run the Get Trades API call, and see the newly created trade in the results. View the tests in the Test Results tab below.
    3. Run the Update Trade API call and view the test results.
    4. Run the Get Trades API call again to see the changed record.
    5. Run the Delete Trade API call and view the test results.
    6. Run the Get Trades API call again to see that the created record has been deleted.
6. All done!
